## 🎯 Project Overview

**My Spotify Wrapped** is a **full-stack web application** that delivers a **comprehensive, interactive dashboard** for analyzing your Spotify listening history. Unlike Spotify's annual Wrapped, this tool offers **real-time, multi-timeframe analytics**, **personalized AI insights**, and **music intelligence** — all wrapped in a sleek, mobile-first interface with glassmorphism design.

Built for music enthusiasts, developers, and data lovers, it showcases modern web development practices and AI integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18.17.0
- npm/yarn/pnpm
- [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
- [Mistral AI API Key](https://console.mistral.ai/) (optional, for AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/murairam/my-spotify-wrapped.git
   cd my-spotify-wrapped
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Configure your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   # NextAuth Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key-here

   # Spotify API Credentials
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-client-secret

   # Mistral AI (Optional - for AI features)
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-api-key
   ```

4. **Configure Spotify App:**
   - Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
   - Create a new app or use existing one
   - Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify` to Redirect URIs
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local`

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open the application:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Production Deployment

**🚀 Live on Vercel**: The application is deployed and accessible at [https://my-spotify-wrapped-one.vercel.app/](https://my-spotify-wrapped-one.vercel.app/)

For your own deployment:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

**Spotify API Limitation**: The live deployment runs in Spotify's development mode, which requires manual approval of test users. Contact me to be added to the approved users list, or clone the project locally for unrestricted access with your own Spotify app credentials.

## 📖 Documentation

### API Endpoints

The application exposes several API routes for data fetching and AI analysis:

- **`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`** - NextAuth.js authentication handler
- **`/api/spotify/profile`** - User profile data
- **`/api/spotify/top-items`** - Top tracks and artists with time range support
- **`/api/spotify/recently-played`** - Recent listening history
- **`/api/spotify/playlists`** - User playlists and metadata
- **`/api/mistral/analyze`** - AI-powered music analysis and recommendations

### Component Architecture

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required for authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=your-domain-or-localhost
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=random-secret-key

# Spotify API (required)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=from-spotify-developer-dashboard
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=from-spotify-developer-dashboard

# Mistral AI (optional - enables AI features)
MISTRAL_API_KEY=from-mistral-console
```

### Spotify App Configuration

1. Create app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Add these scopes: `user-read-private`, `user-read-email`, `user-top-read`, `user-read-recently-played`, `playlist-read-private`
3. Set redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify` (development)
4. For production, add: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/spotify`

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **"Invalid client" error**: Check your Spotify Client ID and Secret
- **"Redirect URI mismatch"**: Ensure redirect URI matches exactly in Spotify dashboard
- **AI features not working**: Verify `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **No data showing**: Check if user has sufficient Spotify listening history

**Development Tips:**

- Use `npm run dev` for development with hot reload
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify environment variables with `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`
- Test with different time ranges if data seems incomplete

## 🧑‍💻 Development Story

This project started as a simple idea for the [Mistral AI Internship Application](https://jobs.lever.co/mistral/a6980b07-e55a-427c-a985-38ecd1e2eea6) but evolved into something much more ambitious.

**What began as a "couple of days" project turned into over two weeks of intensive development**, fueled by countless flat whites and filter coffees at **KB Coffeeroasters** (and yes, my wallet felt every single euro spent on premium coffee ☕).

### The Journey

- **Initial Goal**: Create a simple Spotify data visualization for Mistral AI application
- **Reality**: Fell down a rabbit hole of music analytics, AI integration, and polished UX design
- **Learning Curve**: Mastered Next.js App Router, TypeScript patterns, Spotify Web API intricacies
- **AI Integration**: Deep dive into Mistral AI API for music intelligence features
- **Coffee Consumption**: Immeasurable amounts at KB Coffeeroasters (the baristas know me by name now)

### Technical Achievements

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: From OAuth authentication to AI-powered analytics
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large Spotify datasets
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Custom Chart.js implementations with interactive features
- **AI Integration**: Sophisticated prompt engineering for music personality analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Image optimization, caching, and responsive design

**AI Assistance**: This project was built with significant help from **Mistral AI Chat** and **Claude AI Chat** for problem-solving, code review, and architectural decisions. The AI integration features were particularly enhanced through iterative collaboration with AI tools.
